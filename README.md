## About The Project
Welcome to my workday planning app. Please have fun playing around with the tool (and feel free to use it for your daily ToDos at work!)

I am currently learning third party APIs with eDX's front end coding bootcamp, this is a showcase of the use of jQuery and DayJS to interact with the website and the use of localStorage to persist data entries on the page.

## Built With
-Javascript, using jQuery and DayJS
-HTML & CSS (starter code provided by eDX)

## Getting Started
No installation required, please go ahead and use it!

You can access the application at the following [link](https://kidleis.github.io/calendar-planning-app/)

## Usage

The website should look something like this upon initialisation:

You can input your todos at the relevant hourly timeblocks. If you press the save button, your todos will stay in local storage (until they are overwritten).

## Roadmap
No roadmap! This is the final iteration of this relatively simple tool!
